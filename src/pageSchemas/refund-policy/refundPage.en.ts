                "4.2. No refund for spent Tokens (exceptions). Redeemed Tokens are non-refundable, except where:\n(a) the Output/Service is defective or not as described; or\n(b) Foconta fails to supply the Service as contracted; or\n(c) a refund is otherwise required by law.\n\n" +
                "4.3. Unused Tokens. Unused Tokens are generally refundable at the original purchase price if requested before any redemption from that top-up. Where applicable, non-recoverable payment-processing fees may be deducted.\n\n" +
                "4.4. Account-bound. Tokens are tied to your Account and cannot be transferred between accounts.\n\n" +
                "4.5. No cash-out. Tokens cannot be exchanged for cash or other currencies, unless required by law.\n\n" +
                "4.6. Promotional Tokens. Bonus/promotional Tokens are non-refundable under all circumstances.\n\n" +
                "4.7. Immediate supply of digital content. If you consent to immediate delivery and then open/download the content (e.g., a generated PDF/report/model), you acknowledge your statutory right to cancel may not apply. Refunds are available only under §4.2 or as required by law.\n\n" +
                "4.8. Bespoke/custom work. Custom or tailored Outputs are non-refundable once preparation has substantially begun, unless otherwise agreed in writing.\n\n" +
                "4.9. Standard plan & add-ons (pricing clarity). A standard AI generation carries a base Token price. Optional Add-ons have separate Token prices shown before confirmation and are redeemed in addition to the base price. Once redeemed, add-ons follow the same rules as in this section.",
